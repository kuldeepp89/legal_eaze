            | We eliminate human error and automate processes wherever possible - for instance you need not search for your case status - or miss a date of hearing - if that information is publicly accessible.
          li
            | We allow you to search across, list and sort your schedule using standard parameters.
          li
            | We allow you the flexibility to add all your other engagements - making it easy to consolidate your schedule.
          li
            | And this is more for your assistants/clerks than you; you can even generate your next day's schedule (or if you prefer to call it a "cause-list") showing all your cases and engagements in a standard printable format.
        p
          | We are already working towards developing further features and covering more forums with our automated service as we go forward, ensuring that we continue simplifying your calendar.
